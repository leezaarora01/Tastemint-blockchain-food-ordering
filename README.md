# Tastemint – Blockchain-Enabled Food Ordering Platform

## Project Overview
Tastemint is a web-based food ordering platform developed during a summer internship.
The project leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure payments, transparency,
and automated complaint and refund resolution using smart contracts.

## Problem Statement
Traditional food ordering platforms lack transparency in payments, refunds,
and complaint handling. Tastemint addresses these issues by integrating blockchain
to create a decentralized and trust-based system.

## Key Features

- Blockchain-based payment processing
- Automated refunds (e.g., 10-minute cancellation window)
- Complaint resolution through smart contracts
- All transactions recorded on blockchain
- Decentralized user experience using wallet integration (MetaMask)

## How It Works
